Once again, we see Total Fares are highest in the urban areas mostly because of the highest number of rides.  This stays consistent over Q1.

In summary, Drivers in the Rural and Suburban areas have higher profitability, but that may be due to the higher average fare amounts.  Urban areas are busier, but with shorter fares.
